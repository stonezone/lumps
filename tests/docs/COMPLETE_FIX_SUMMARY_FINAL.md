# LUMPS Complete Fix Summary

## All Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Current Data Source Priority
- Fixed data source lookup to check 'pacioos_enhanced' first
- Ensures enhanced current data is properly utilized when --enhanced-currents flag is used

### 2. ✅ Current Direction Range Corrected (10-80°)
- Updated from dangerous 60-120° (includes ESE toward shore) to safe 10-80° (coast-parallel)
- Now captures NNE to ENE currents that flow parallel to the north shore
- Avoids currents that would push riders toward the rocky coastline

### 3. ✅ Key Compatibility Fixed
- Added 'surfable_conditions' key that the code was looking for
- Fixed the root cause of "NO OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOUND" error
- Maintained backward compatibility with 'optimal_conditions'

### 4. ✅ Wind Scoring Logic Fixed
- Added wind speed validation to prevent false "excellent" ratings
- <12kt wind → "marginal" only (no lumps)
- 12-15kt → "moderate" maximum
- 15kt+ → Full scoring applies (proper downwind conditions)

### 5. ✅ NOAA Coastal Waters Forecast Integration
- Added new high-quality wind data source
- Provides official 5-day marine forecasts for Oahu Leeward Waters
- Priority order: NDBC → NOAA Weather → NOAA CWF → OpenMeteo

## Code Changes Summary:

1. **data_sources.py**:
   - Line ~1497: Check 'pacioos_enhanced' before 'pacioos'
   - Line ~1066: Eastward range changed to 10-80°
   - Line ~1209: Added 'surfable_conditions' key
   - Line ~919: Added NOAACWFWindSource class
   - Line ~1681: Added NOAA CWF to data sources
   - Line ~1853: Added NOAA CWF to wind priority

2. **analysis.py**:
   - Line ~65: Added wind speed validation to scoring
   - Line ~20: Updated eastward_current_range to (10, 80)

## Testing Instructions:

```bash
# Run full analysis with all fixes
python lumps.py --enhanced-currents --start-date 2025-08-05 --days 5 --verbose

# Check key fixes in logs
grep "Using PacIOOS Enhanced" lumps.log          # Should see enhanced data
grep "eastward flow periods (010-080°)" lumps.log # Correct range
grep "NOAA Coastal Waters Forecast" lumps.log     # New data source
grep "Surfable: True" lumps.log                   # Fixed key issue

# Verify results
tail -20 data/optimal_conditions_*.csv
```

## Expected Results:

### Before Fixes:
- "NO EASTWARD CURRENT CONDITIONS FOUND"
- 8.7kt wind rated as "EXCELLENT"
- Currents at 349° and 157° marked as optimal
- Missing 'surfable_conditions' key

### After Fixes:
- Finds optimal conditions for proper dates
- Only 15kt+ winds can be rated "good" or better
- Only 10-80° currents (coast-parallel) are considered
- NOAA CWF provides official marine forecasts

The system now accurately identifies optimal downwind foiling conditions with:
- Strong ENE trade winds (15kt+)
- Coast-parallel opposing currents (10-80°)
- Proper tidal enhancement
- Multiple high-quality data sources
