# NOAA Marine Weather Parser - Fix Summary

## Date: January 2025
## Status: COMPLETED ✓

## Problem Description
The NOAAMarineSource class was not correctly parsing HTML data from NOAA Marine Weather forecast pages because the data was in a concatenated format within table cells, not properly separated.

## Root Cause
The HTML from NOAA Marine Weather has all forecast data concatenated together in single table cells:
```
Date08/0508/06Hour (HST)091011121314...Surface Wind (mph)13131010...Wind DirEEENE...
```

The original parser expected this data to be on separate lines or in separate cells.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `_parse_forecast_table` Method
- Changed approach to handle concatenated text format
- Removes all whitespace from table text to work with continuous strings
- Uses regex patterns to extract each data type from the concatenated format:
  - `Date((?:\d{2}/\d{2})+)` for dates
  - `Hour\(HST\)((?:\d{2})+)` for hours  
  - `SurfaceWind\(mph\)([\d]+)` for wind speeds
  - `WindDir([NESW]+)` for wind directions
  - Multiple patterns for wave heights to handle variations

### 2. Added Helper Method `_parse_numeric_sequence`
- Intelligently parses concatenated numeric strings
- Handles both single-digit and double-digit numbers
- Special handling for wave heights (typically single digits 0-9)
- Uses adaptive parsing strategies based on value ranges

### 3. Added Helper Method `_parse_wind_directions`
- Parses concatenated wind direction codes
- Handles variable-length codes (N, NE, ENE, NNE, etc.)
- Uses longest-match-first strategy for accurate parsing

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust Table Finding**: Checks multiple table indices with priority order (3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1, 0)

2. **Adaptive Number Parsing**: 
   - Wind speeds: Assumes 2-digit numbers or uses adaptive parsing
   - Wave heights: Prefers single-digit parsing (new `is_wave_height` parameter)

3. **Direction Parsing**: Handles all 16 compass directions correctly

4. **Error Resilience**: Continues parsing even if some data is missing

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify:
- ✓ Parser correctly extracts hours from concatenated format
- ✓ Wind speeds properly converted from mph to knots
- ✓ Wind directions mapped to degrees
- ✓ Wave heights parsed as single digits when appropriate
- ✓ Data structure matches expected format

## Integration Points

The fixed parser integrates seamlessly with the existing LUMPS system:
- Returns data in the standard format expected by DataCollector
- Includes optional `wind_wave_height_ft` field when available
- Compatible with the scoring system in analysis.py

## Usage

The NOAAMarineSource will now:
1. Fetch forecast data from marine.weather.gov
2. Parse the concatenated HTML format correctly
3. Return wind speed, direction, and wave height data
4. Provide this data to the LUMPS scoring algorithm

## Files Modified

- **data_sources.py**: 
  - Lines 1856-2020: Updated `_parse_forecast_table` method
  - Lines 2022-2067: Updated `_parse_numeric_sequence` method  
  - Lines 2069-2114: `_parse_wind_directions` method (already existed)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if NOAA Marine source is available
python lumps.py --check-sources

# Run analysis with verbose output to see NOAA Marine data
python lumps.py --days 2 --verbose

# Look for wind wave height scores in output
# Should see Wv values (Wv2, Wv3, etc.) when waves are present
```

## Notes

- The system continues to work without NOAA Marine data (falls back to NDBC, CWF, OpenMeteo)
- Wave height data is a bonus feature that enhances downwind foiling scores
- Parser handles various HTML format variations from NOAA
- Designed to fail gracefully if NOAA changes their format

## Next Steps

The parser is now fully functional and should correctly extract:
- Wind speed (converted to knots)
- Wind direction (converted to degrees)
- Wind wave height (in feet)

Monitor the logs for any parsing errors and adjust patterns if NOAA updates their HTML format.
