# LUMPS Current Flow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Enhanced Current Data Not Used**: 
   - Fixed `find_optimal_conditions()` to check for 'pacioos_enhanced' FIRST when using --enhanced-currents
   - This ensures enhanced current data is properly utilized

2. **Wrong Current Direction Range**:
   - Changed from overly broad 0-180Â° to proper eastward range 60-120Â°
   - This range (ENE to ESE) properly opposes ENE trade winds (50-70Â°)
   - Previous range included North and South currents which don't create the desired effect

3. **Added Debug Logging**:
   - Shows which data sources are available
   - Logs which current data source is being used

## Changes Made

### File: data_sources.py

1. **Line ~1497**: Updated priority order to check 'pacioos_enhanced' first
2. **Line ~1066**: Changed eastward flow range from 0-180Â° to 60-120Â°
3. **Line ~1076**: Updated flow categorization bins to match new range
4. **Line ~1154**: Updated is_eastward check to use 60-120Â° range
5. **Various**: Updated logging messages to reflect correct range
6. **Line ~1482**: Added debug logging for available data sources

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- Currents at 349Â° (North) and 157Â° (SSE) marked as "optimal"
- System not using enhanced current data properly
- Too many false positives for optimal conditions

### After Fix:
- Only true eastward currents (60-120Â°) will be identified
- Enhanced current data will be properly utilized
- Clear logging showing data source selection

## Testing Instructions

```bash
# Test with enhanced currents for the dates shown in JPGs
python lumps.py --enhanced-currents --start-date 2025-08-06 --days 3 --verbose

# Check the log for proper data source selection
grep -i "Using PacIOOS Enhanced" lumps.log

# Verify only eastward currents are found
grep -i "eastward flow periods (060-120Â°)" lumps.log

# Check the CSV output for current directions
tail -20 data/optimal_conditions_*.csv | awk -F',' '{print $1, "dir:", $3}'
```

## What to Look For

1. Log should show "Using PacIOOS Enhanced ROMS model forecast"
2. Current directions in optimal conditions should be between 60-120Â°
3. Fewer but more accurate optimal conditions should be found
4. The conditions should match the patterns shown in the aug6.jpg, aug7.jpg, aug8.jpg reference images
